    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Ecava IntegraXor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files within the Inkscape component. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
