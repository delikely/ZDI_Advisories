    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ecava IntegraXor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of WMF files within the Inkscape component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
