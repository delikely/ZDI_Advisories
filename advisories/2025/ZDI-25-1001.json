    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the clfs.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated memory region. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
