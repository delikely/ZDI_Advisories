An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. Additional user interaction is required in that an administrator must begin a cleanup of temporary files on the system.\nThe specific flaw exists within the CleanDrive service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to delete arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
