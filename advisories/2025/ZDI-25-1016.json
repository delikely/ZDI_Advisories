    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Wibu-Systems WibuKey Runtime. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Wibukey2_64.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
