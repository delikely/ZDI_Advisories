    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NVIDIA Megatron. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the load_common function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
