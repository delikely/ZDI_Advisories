    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject unexpected hyperlinks on affected installations of Microsoft SharePoint. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of calendar overlays. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary hyperlink. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to redirect a target user to a deceptive, untrusted page.",
