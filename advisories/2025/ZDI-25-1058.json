    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disguise hard links on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the rendering of the contents of TAR files. Windows displays hard links within TAR files without providing any visual indication to differentiate them from normal files.
