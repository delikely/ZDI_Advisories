    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Net-SNMP. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the SnmpTrapd service, which listens on UDP port 162 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.",
