    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Lexmark CX331adwe printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the PATH_TRANSLATED parameter provided to the basic_auth.cgi endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the pagemaker user.",
