    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Apache ActiveMQ NMS. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Body accessor method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
