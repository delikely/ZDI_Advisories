    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of JupyterLab. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the vulnerability is triggered only when a target user makes use of the product.\nThe specific flaw exists within the jupyter-lab process. The process loads a configuration script from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of a target user.",
