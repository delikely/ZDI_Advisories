    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Sony XAV-AX8500 devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of Bluetooth packets. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the elysian-bt-service process.",
