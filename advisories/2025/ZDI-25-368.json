    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the BuildEnterpriseSearchString method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the user.",
