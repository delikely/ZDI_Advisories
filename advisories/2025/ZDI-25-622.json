    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3150 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the configuration service, which listens on TCP port 5001 by default.
