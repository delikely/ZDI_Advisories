    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of hfsc_class objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
