    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Apple macOS. Interaction with the libFontValidation library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of kern tables. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
