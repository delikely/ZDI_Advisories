    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to smuggle arbitrary HTTP requests on affected installations of QNAP QHora-322 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the local_pwd_reset endpoint. The issue results from the inconsistent parsing of terminators of HTTP headers. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device.",
