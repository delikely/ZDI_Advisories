    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of QNAP TS-464 devices. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the qnap_exec function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the user.",
