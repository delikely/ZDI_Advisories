    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of QNAP TS-464 devices. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the privWizard.cgi endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper neutralization of CRLF sequences. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the user.",
