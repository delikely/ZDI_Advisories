    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of QNAP QHora-322 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the username parameter provided to the qsyslog-cli executable. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it as a format specifier.
