    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Google Drive. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Google Drive desktop application for Windows. When syncing files shared from a untrusted account, the Google Drive desktop application does not apply the Mark-of-the-Web to the local copies of the files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
