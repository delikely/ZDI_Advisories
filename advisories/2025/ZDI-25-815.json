    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of CAB files. When extracting files from a CAB file served from an untrusted location, Windows does not apply the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
