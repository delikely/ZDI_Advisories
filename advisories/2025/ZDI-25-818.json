    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of OneDrive file syncing. When syncing files from the cloud to the local filesystem, OneDrive neither applies nor preserves the Mark-of-the-Web on files originating from untrusted locations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass SmartScreen protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
