    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass the SmartScreen security feature on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of NetBIOS hostnames. By advertising a NetBIOS name on a host, an attacker can bypass SmartScreen on files originating from that host when accessed via the NetBIOS name. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
