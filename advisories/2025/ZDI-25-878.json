    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
