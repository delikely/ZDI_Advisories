    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Delta Electronics COMMGR. An attacker must first obtain the ability to compromise a PLC in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of packets received from a PLC. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the application.",
