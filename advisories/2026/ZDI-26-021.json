    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of gemini-mcp-tool. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the execAsync method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.",
