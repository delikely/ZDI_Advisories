    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the VMSVGA device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.",
