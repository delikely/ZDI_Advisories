    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Docker Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of procfs arguments. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilties to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
